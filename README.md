# Recon's Factorio Mods

This repository is home to the Factorio mods I'm working on. Right now, I'm still a novice, and most of this code is
hacked together from other mods with borrowed assets. I don't intend it for distribution - hence why I haven't uploaded
it to the mod portal. Currently, the primary purpose of this code is to have a couple of lightweight mods I can use in
my vanilla-like mega-base for testing various aspects of logistics. Part of the goal of MegaLab is to develop tools and
strategies that work for vanilla, so things like recipe rebalancing are a no-go as far as the save file is concerned.
These mods represent in many ways an attempt to extract just the pieces of other mods that I need, pulling from my
favorites and modifying them so that they work in a vanilla environment with zero other changes. Credit for developing
most of the code and graphics goes out to other authors, as does credit for getting me into the modding scene, and in a
larger sense the Factorio-enthusiast scene in general. Thanks to all the people who've helped along the way.

## Recon's Logistics

Currently, the only thing this contains is an additional two tiers of belts: one at sixty items per second, and a second
at ninety items per second. I've done my best to balance the recipes for vanilla, although it's worth noting that
without additional rarer or harder-to-acquire materials, the best I could do was make them more expensive. I've also
made the decision to more strongly limit the underground belt lengths to be more vanilla-like in feel, rather than the
huge underground spans common to most other mods.

## Recon's Production

Currently, this pulls in just the drills and furnaces from AAI Industry, with the goal of making it so that I can use
non-gargantuan setups with modules and beacons for my processing. I've always liked Earendel's take on furnaces and
drills in particular, especially because he makes them different sizes and therefore not strict upgrades of the weaker
variants. The additional build-around potential of the differently-sized and moduled assets is exactly the kind of
logistics challenge I'm looking for in my base.
